# Neural Network for Multiclass Classification 
This project implements a neural network for multiclass classification from scratch.

## Requirements & Instructions to run the code
### Requirements
Make sure you have the following packages installed:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- pandas

### Install on Linux/MacOS
If you don't have the required packages, you can install them using the `requirements.txt` file by running the following commands:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or, if you already have an active environment you can only run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To deactivate the virtual environment, use:
```sh
deactivate
```

Finally, to run the code:
```sh
cd src
python main.py
```

### Install on Windows 
If you don't have the required packages, you can install them using the script `start_program.py` file by running the following command:
```sh
python .\src\start_program.py
```

To run the code:
```sh
cd .\src
python main.py
```

> **Note:** There is a file `constants.py` where you can set the constants of the model as needed.
